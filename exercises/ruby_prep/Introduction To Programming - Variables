1. Write a program called name.rb that asks the user to type in their name and then prints out a greeting message with their name included.
Solution:
> puts "Hi! What is your name?"
> user_name = gets.chomp
> puts "Greetings " + user_name + "!"

2. Write a program that asks a user how old they are and then tells them how old 
they will be in 10, 20, 30 and 40 years. Below is the output for someone 20 years old.

How old are you?
In 10 years you will be:
30
In 20 years you will be:
40
In 30 years you will be:
50
In 40 years you will be:
60

Solution:
> puts "How old are you?"

> user_age = gets.chomp.to_i

> user_age_plus_10 = user_age + 10
> user_age_plus_20 = user_age + 20
> user_age_plus_30 = user_age + 30
> user_age_plus_40 = user_age + 40

> puts "In 10 years you will be:\n" + user_age_plus_10.to_s
> puts "In 20 years you will be:\n" + user_age_plus_20.to_s
> puts "In 30 years you will be:\n" + user_age_plus_30.to_s
> puts "In 40 years you will be:\n" + user_age_plus_40.to_s

3. Add another section onto name.rb that prints the name of the user 10 times. You must do this without explicitly writing the puts method 10 times in a row. Hint: you can use the times method to do something repeatedly.
Solution:
10.times do
  puts name
end

4. Modify name.rb again so that it first asks the user for their first name, saves it into a variable, and then does the same for the last name. Then outputs their full name all at once.
Solution:

puts "Please enter your first name: "
first_name = gets.chomp

puts "Please enter your last name: "
last_name = gets.chomp

puts "Your full name is: " + first_name + " " + last_name

5. Look at the following programs...
----
x = 0

3.times do
  x += 1
end

puts x
----

# and #

----
y = 0

3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end

puts x
----

What does x print to the screen in each case? Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?
Solution:
For the first case, x will incremented by 1 3 times, so the result is x = 3.
For the second case, it will result in an error because x is initialized as a local variable inside the method,
therefore, puts x will throw an error because hasnt been initialized in the outer scope.

6. What does the following error message tell you?
NameError: undefined local variable or method "shoes" for main:Object

Solution: The variable named "shoes" has not been initialized yet and Ruby tried to execute an expression that
is trying to use the undefined variable.
