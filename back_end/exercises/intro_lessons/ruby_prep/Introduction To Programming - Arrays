1. Below we have given you an array and a number. Write a program that checks 
to see if number is in array.
Solution: 
  arr = [1,3,4,5,2,11]
  number = 3
  puts arr.include?(number)

Alternative:
  arr = [1,3,5,6,7,11]
  number = 3
  arr.each do |num|
    if num == number
      put "#{number} is in the array"
    end
  emd

2. What will the following programs return? What is value of arr after each?
  1. arr = ["b", "a"]
     arr = arr.product(Array(1..3))
     arr.first.delete(arr.first.last)
     Solution: [["b"], ["b", 2], ["b", 3], ["a", 1], ["a", 2], ["a", 3]]

  2. arr = ["b", "a"]
     arr = arr.product([Array(1..3)])
     arr.first.delete(arr.first.last)
     Solution: [["b"], ["a", [1,2,3]]]

3. How would you print the word "example" from array?
  arr = [["test", "hello", "world"],["example", "mem"]]
  Solution: arr.first.last

4. What does each method return in the following example?
  arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]

  1. arr.index(5)
  Solution: 8
  
  2. arr.index[5]
  Solution: error

  2. arr[5]
  Solution: 8

5. What is the value of a, b, and c in the following program?
string = "Welcome to America!"
a = string[6]
b = string[11]
c = string[19]

Solution: a is "e", b is "A", c is nil

6. You run the following code...

names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
names['margaret'] = 'jody'

...and get the following error message:

TypeError: no implicit conversion of String into Integer
  from (irb):2:in `[]='
  from (irb):2
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

What is the problem and how can it be fixed?

Solution: replace 'margaret' with index 3.

7. Write a program that iterates over an array and builds a new array that
is the result of incrementing each value in original array by value of 2.
You shoud have two arrays at the end of the program. Print both arrays using p.
Solution:
numbers = [3,4,5,6,7]
y = numbers.map {|n| n+2}
p numbers
p y
