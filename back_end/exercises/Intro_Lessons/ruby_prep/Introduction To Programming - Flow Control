1. Write down whether the following is true of false.
  1. (32 * 4) >= 129
  Solution: false
  2. false != !true
  Solution: false
  3. true == 4
  Solution: false
  4. false == (847 == '874')
  Solution: true
  5. (!true || (!(100/5) == 20) || ((328 / 4) == 82)) || false
  Solution: true

2. Write a method that takes a string as argument. The method should return the all_caps
  version of string if and only the string is longer then 10 characters.
  Solution:
  def conver_to_upper(str)
    if str.length > 10
      str.upcase
    end
      str
  end

3. Write a program that takes a number from user between 0 and 100 and reports back whether
the number is between 0 and 50, 51 and 100, or above 100.
number = gets.chomp.to_i

result = case
when number >= 0 && number <= 50
  puts "Number is between 0 and 50"
when number = 51 && number<= 100
  puts "Number is between 51 and 100"
when number >= 101
  puts "Number is greater than 100"
end
 
4. What will each block of code print to screen?
  1.'4' == 4 ? puts("TRUE") : puts("FALSE")
  Solution: "FALSE" since string == integer is false

  2. x = 2
     if ((x * 3) / 2) == (4 + 4 - x -3)
        puts "Did you get it right?"
     else
        puts "Did you?"
     end
  Solution: "Did you get it right?"

  3. y = 9
     x = 10
     if (x + 1) <= (y)
        puts "Alright."
     elsif (x + 1) >= (y)
        puts "Alright now!"
     elsif (y + 1) == x
        puts "ALRIGHT NOW!"
     else
        puts "Alrighty!"
     end
  Solution: "Alright now!"

6. When you run the following code...
def equal_to_four(x)
  if x == 4
    puts "yup"
  else
    puts "nope"
  end
end

You get the following error message..
test_code.rb:96: syntax error, unexpected end-of-input, expecting keyword_end

Why do you get this error and how can you fix it?
Solution: Add keyword 'end' after the if-else statement.
