1. Add two strings together that, when concatenated, return your first and last name as your fullname in one string.
Solution: "John" + " Nash"

2. Use modulo operator, division, or combination of both to take 4 digit number and find digit in the
  1) Thousands place
    Solution: 4936 / 1000
  2) Hundreds place
    Solution: 4936 % 1000 / 100
  3) Tens place
    Solution: 4936 % 1000 % 100 / 10
  4) Ones place
    Solution: 4936 % 1000 % 100 % 10

3. Write a program that uses a hash to store a list of movie titles with the year they came out. Then
use 'puts' to make your program print out year of each movie to screen.
Solution: movies = {dark_knight: 2008,
                    captain_america: 2011,
                    juno: 2007,
                    hobbit: 2012}
          puts movies[:dark_knight] # 2008
          ...

4. Use dates from the previous example and store them in array.
Solution: movie_dates = [2008, 2011, 2007, 2012]
          puts movie_dates[0]
          ...
          puts movie_dates[3]

5. Write a program that outputs factorial of number 5,6,7,8.
Solution: puts 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
          puts 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
          ...

6. Write a program that calculates squares of 3 float numbers of your choosing.
Solution: puts 1.25 * 1.25
          puts 1.712 * 1.712
          puts 3.21 * 3.21

7. What does the following error message tell you?
Syntax Error : (irb) : 2: Syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
Solution: Misplaced the end of hash with ')'. 
          test = {'w' : 123) # should be test = {'w' : 123}
