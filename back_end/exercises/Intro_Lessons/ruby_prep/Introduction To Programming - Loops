1. What does the 'each' method in the following program return after it is finish executing?
x = [1,2,3,4,5]
x.each do |a|
a + 1
end
Solution: returns the original array.

2. Write a loop that takes input from user, performs an action, and only stops when user types "STOP".
Each loop can get info from the user.
Solution:
while true
  puts "Enter a number or type 'STOP'"
  x = gets.chomp
  
  if x == 'STOP'
    break
  end

  puts "Your number is #{x}"
  puts "Cool!"
end

3. Use with_each_index method to iterate through an array of your creation that prints each index and value of
array.
Solution: [1,2,3,4].each_with_index { |i,v| puts "#{i}. #{v}"}

4. Write a method that counts down to zero using recursion.
Solution:
def count_down(number)
  if number >= 0
    puts number
    count_down(number - 1)
  end
end
